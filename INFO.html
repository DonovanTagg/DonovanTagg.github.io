  <p> Hello. My name is Donovan and I am an avid fan of Urealms live and have followed Rob for a long time, even before Urealms. I have made this website to help introduce people to the very very basics of the game. And because I really love this show and its creator and players. I would like to say that you should not use this website if you already understand the game and or want specifics about PC or cards and the like. Those are present within the actual website. Thank you very much for visiting my website and I hope you enjoy  </p>
  <H2> THANKS!!</H2>
